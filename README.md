# About
Hello and Welcome!

My name is Kingsley Nwoye, and I am a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur with over half a decade of experience in technology. I’m the Founder and CEO of Range Universe, where I focus on a customer-first approach to building companies. I work closely with customers to gather feedback, refine products, oversee public communications, and manage early-stage recruitment to ensure the team remains aligned with the mission.

Through my work, I provide a range of professional services, including Android and iOS Development, Web Development, Custom Software Development, Cloud Application Development, Cloud Management, Software Testing, and Web Design.

My direct involvement with customers guides strategic decisions and helps shape a strong, value-driven company culture.
