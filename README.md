# About
A seasoned software engineer with over 5 years of software development experience, I have mastered the craft of driving successful frontend development initiatives in cross-functional teams for digital products that have won the hearts of millions of users.

I specialize in partnering with software leads to develop product strategy and vision, and I have a passion for being hands-on in helping teams deliver high-quality user experience solutions through a development process that includes research, prototyping, and iterative improvements.

In my past roles, I have been responsible for managing development operations programs that improved collaboration between developers and product teams by optimizing processes, frameworks, and development standards.

When I'm not working on projects, I enjoy helping developers with portfolio feedback and career growth advice.
